# unit-4-game

This game is a was an assignment designed to help us familiarize ourselves with using jQuery to manipulate the DOM. In this game, the computer generates five random numbers to start - 1 for your target score, and 1 for each crystal button on the page. The user doesn't know the values assigned to the crystal until they click on them, so they must be strategic in their clicks to hit the target score. Once the user's score is greater than or equal to the target score, the game resets and a win or loss is added to the user's total.
