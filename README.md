# unit-4-game

This challenge for this assignment was to build a game using jQuery where the computer would generate 5 numbers at the start of the game -- one for the player's target score, and one each for the crystals displayed on the page. The goal of the game is to match your score with the target score by clicking on the crystals, whose values are hidden. 

To complete this assignment, I created a function to generate the random numbers first. Then, I wrote functions to add the value of the respective crystal to the "total score" element on the page dynamically as well as functions to check if the players score matched or exceeded the target score after every click.
